# Chombo_3.2/releasedExamples/Proto/amr_viscous_tensor
* amr_viscous_tensor uses AMRMultiGrid and Proto_Viscous_Tensor_Op to solve the variable-coefficient viscous tensor equation.

# Files
* amr_viscous_tensor.cpp : main file that runs solver.
* _inputs/case_0.inputs : inputs for single level with domain decomposition solves 
* _inputs/case_1.inputs : simple AMR case
