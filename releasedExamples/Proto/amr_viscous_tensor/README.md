# Chombo_3.2/releasedExamples/Proto/amr_conductivity
* amr_conductivity uses AMRMultiGrid and Proto_Conductivity_Op to solve the variable-coefficient Helmholtz equation.

# Files
* amr_conductivity.cpp : main file that runs solver.
* _inputs/case_0.inputs : inputs for single level with domain decomposition solves 
* _inputs/case_1.inputs : simple AMR case
