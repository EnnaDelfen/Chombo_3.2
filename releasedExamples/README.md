# Chombo3.2/releasedExamples/Proto
* A set of examples to show how to use Chombo with proto for performance portability.

# Directories
* Poisson is a Chombo port of a proto example (single grid Poisson solver using multigrid).
* common holds code used by several examples
* data_transfer tests moving data between proto and Chombo data types.
* amr_helmoltz uses AMRMultiGrid and proto to solve the constant-coefficient Helmholtz equation.
